  <b>I'm Praveen. I studying at C.Kandaswami Naidu College in Anna Nagar,Chennai.<br>
     I successfully wasted 3 years in college by without learning anything. In my last<br>
      semester I thought about my life and career and then I thouht why I wouldn't become <br>
      a web developer. Then I bought a full stack web development course in online. As I <br>
      learning, I became interested on web development and I still learning.</b>
